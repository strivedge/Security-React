First the device must be identified. The availability of a unique identifier is going to depend on the device vendor, and the openness of the vendor's API, whether or not the device is under EMM\/MDM control and, if so, the approach used by the developer of the EMM\/MDM. There are many different types of identifiers (e.g., UDID, UUID, Android ID, IMEI, MAC Address, serial number, MDM generated ID) that can be used to identify the device, and an organization must choose an approach that applies under their specific circumstances. Once the device is identified and authenticated, it is checked to ensure it complies with appropriate configuration settings and software versions for the operating system and applications. At the same time the device is checked to ensure anti-virus software is running with current definitions. Finally, hardware configurations are checked to ensure any disallowed features are turned off. <br><br>\n\n<b>Example<\/b> <br>\n\nYour organization has a policy that provides guidelines for using mobile devices such as iPads, tablets, mobile phones, PDAs.

It addresses information flow among domains containing CUI and those that do not. While access control is concerned with controlling access to information by users and processes, controlling information flow (information flow control) is concerned with where information is allowed to move within a system and between systems. In general, information flow control can apply to any needed flow restrictions. For this CMMC practice the flows of concern are primarily between CUI authorized and CUI not-authorized components\/systems. Any attempt to move CUI to a domain that has not been designated as a domain allowed to store or process CUI must be blocked.<br><br>\n\n<b>Example<\/b><br>\n\nYou are the IT administrator for your organization. You have designed the network in each of the regional offices to have two zones: one zone that can store and process CUI data and a second zone where CUI information is not permitted. A firewall separates the two zones in the office so staff cannot access files and resources within the office, and a site-to-site VPN over the corporate WAN allows the CUI zones to communicate. To ensure separation between CUI projects, staff are given file access permissions to project servers and file stores by project. To facilitate the transfer of CUI files and data between the same project team working in each regional office, you install a SharePoint server on the CUI zone of the headquarters office. Authorized staff have accounts and use their MFA token to log into the SharePoint server to view or modify projects files stored there.",
